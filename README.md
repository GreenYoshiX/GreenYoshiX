Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...   A fun (hopefully) 2D video game that spreads the gospel of Jesus Christ! Hosted by Gustav!
[Gustav](https://github.com/GreenYoshiX/GreenYoshiX/assets/148284948/58218b51-5e7f-47ce-9670-71dde215bf19)!   Not the best picture of him...

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...     Continually learning coding (particularly Python) and gaining tech knowledge in general. I'm fairly new to the scene and excited to learn.
All praises be to the Lord our God!

Yahweh is my shepherd; I shall not want --- Psalm 23:1 (LSB)

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God. --- John 1:1 (KJV)

Then if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. ---Romans 10:9-10! (KJV)
